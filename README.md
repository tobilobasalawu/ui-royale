# UI-Royale

A live multiplayer game where teams compete to design the best UI using Superflex, guided by a text prompt (e.g., "Build a TikTok for cats"). Players collaborate in real time, dragging and styling components on a shared canvas, while an AI judge scores their creativity, accessibility, and adherence to the prompt.
